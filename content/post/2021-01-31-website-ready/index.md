Today I finally figured out why I always got an error message when trying to configure the "custom resource records" in Google Domains' DNS. I found [this post](https://www.thewichitacomputerguy.com/comment/1087) and did the same mistake of overlooking a plus sign. I've just fixed it and now my website https://jubarlystudio.com/ is finally online.

I also added a top level post [About this website](/about-this-website/).
