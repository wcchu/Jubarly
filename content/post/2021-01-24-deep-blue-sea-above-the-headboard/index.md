There is a pretty nice space above the bed on the headboard side in our bedroom. FC and I talked about hanging up a larger painting to replace the current one, which is kind of too small to the wall space, as seen in the picture below.

*An oil painting by myself (Spree at Night - oil on canvas, 50 cm x 40 cm, [link to Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxKQx0enx7m/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)) is hanging on the wall above our headboard.*

Since about a year ago we have had this idea, and bought a canvas in the size of 120 cm by 40 cm around that time. We had discussed what theme to put in the painting since then but couldn't conclude. For a while we thought of painting a yellow U-bahn train running on top of Oberbaumbr√ºcke, but that idea turned old and we didn't like it anymore. At the end, we came to the conclusion that this painting should be something calm and neutral, with some simple shapes and colors, but nothing complicated or provocative. In other words, it's decorative.

At the beginning of this year, an image emerged in our mind. We would paint the whole thing blue like a view under the sea looking up. There would be some bright light coming from above the sea to give it a sense of space. We would paint some fish patterns in gold and let it flow across the canvas.

Because the size of the painting is quite large to us, we made a small version of it on paper first, as a reference. The paper is for oil so the colors of the small version could be as true to the real one as possible. We cut fish shapes out of a golden glossy paper and glue them to the picture.

Then I painted the large canvas. The blue part is done and we are waiting the paint to dry. The progress is shown in the picture below. The next will be cutting and pasting fish on it after the paint is dry.

*We are creating a larger piece to replace the painting currently on the wall.*

To be honest, we are not totally satisfied with how the fish look. I think they are too concentrated and the line they form is too straight. It feels stiff and unnatural. But that's something we can experiment with later when having the cut fish at hand.

In general, a painting is decorative means it is boring. I think it's true in our case as well, but we don't mind it being boring, because it's something on top of the bed and something you see every night. We want it to be large and sharp enough to fit the size and background color (white) of the space, but calm and quiet enough for a relaxing environment.
