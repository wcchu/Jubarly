Above the bed's headboard in our bedroom, FC and I currently hang a small painting on the wall. It's a 50 cm by 40 cm oil painting that I made in 2019. It looks like this:

*An oil painting by myself (Spree at Night - oil on canvas, 50 cm x 40 cm, [link to Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxKQx0enx7m/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)) is hanging on the wall above our headboard.*

About a year ago, we started to have the idea of changing it to a larger painting, which would suit the size of wall better. We then bought a canvas in the size of 120 cm by 40 cm around that time. We had discussed about the theme of the painting since then but just couldn't conclude. Nevertheless we both agree that this painting should have just simple shapes and colors, but nothing fancy or provocative.

At the beginning of this year, an image emerged in our mind. We would paint the whole thing blue like a view under the sea looking up. There would be some bright light coming from above the sea to give it a sense of space. We would add some fish in gold and let it flow across the canvas.

Because the size of the painting is quite large, we made a small version of it on paper first, as a reference. We painted the small version with oil colors first, then cut fish shapes out of a golden glossy paper and glue them to the surface.

Then I painted the large canvas using the same colors. The sea part is done and we are waiting for the paint to dry. Its current state is shown in the picture below. The next will be cutting and pasting fish on it after the paint dries.

*We are creating a large painting on canvas following the small version on paper.*

We are not totally satisfied with how the fish look in the small version. They are positioned too close and the line they form is too straight. It feels stiff and unnatural. But that's something we can try out ourselves later on the large canvas when having the cut fish at hand.

In general, a decorative artwork means a boring artwork. I think it's true in our case as well, but we don't mind it being "boring", because it's something right above the bed, to be seen every night at bedtime. We want it to be large and sharp enough to fit the size and the whiteness of the wall, but calm and quiet enough to make a relaxing environment.
