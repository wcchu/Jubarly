Every year, FC and I make Christmas or New Year's cards. When we tried to run through 2020 for the design inspirations, it seemed to us so dominated by Covid to the extent that not much else were there to talk about. Our only memorable part of last year was the summer months between the first wave and the second wave of the outbreak, when the situation was relatively calm and we squeezed in two short trips to the Mediterranean Sea. Even when we think about 2021, our wishes are surrounding this pandemic--we just want it gone and never coming back again.

The design of this card is to capture such (wishful) transition from 2020 to 2021, from Covid to non-Covid. The cover looks like this:

The colorful ball is, quite obviously, a virus particle. It is now being destroyed by some strong wind that scatters its spikes in the air. They are just like the pappus of a dandelion flower, blown away by the wind. Under the virus' surface, the earth is recovering and revealing its healthy green and blue, while the toxic foam is fading away. That's a "Goodbye 2020" which essentially means goodbye to Covid.
