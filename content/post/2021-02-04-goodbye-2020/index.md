Every year, FC and I make Christmas or New Year's cards. Looking back, our 2020 was so dominated by the Coronavirus to the extent that not much else were there to talk about. Our only memorable part of last year was the summer months between the 1st wave and the 2nd wave of the outbreak, when the situation was relatively peaceful and we had two short trips to the Mediterranean Sea. Even when we talk about 2021, our wishes are surrounding this pandemic--we just want it gone and to never come back again.

The design of the card is to capture this (wishful) transition, from Covid to no-Covid, from 2020 to 2021. The cover looks like this:

The ball is, quite obviously, a virus particle. It is being destroyed by some strong wind that scattered its spikes in the air. It's just like the pappus of a dandelion flower blown away by the wind. Under the virus' surface, the earth is recovering and revealing its healthy green and blue, while the toxic foam fades away.
