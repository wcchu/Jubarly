Every year, FC and I make Christmas or New Year's cards. At the end of 2020, when we tried to think through the year retrospectively for design inspirations, it appeared to be so dominated by Covid to the extent that not much else were there to talk about. Our only memorable part of 2020 was the summer months between the first wave and the second wave of the outbreak, when the situation was relatively calm and we squeezed in two short trips to the Mediterranean Sea. Even when we think about 2021, our wishes are all about this pandemic--we just want it gone and never coming back again.

Let's go straight to the end result first. Here is the group photo of all the cards:

The cover looks like this:

And the inner page, which is right on the back to the cover, looks like this:

The design of this card is to capture the (wishful) transition from 2020 to 2021, from Covid to non-Covid. The colorful ball on the cover is, very obviously, a virus particle. In the picture, it is being destroyed by some strong wind that sends the spikes of the virus to the air. These spikes are just like the pappus of a dandelion flower, blown away by the wind. Under the virus' surface, the earth is recovering, revealing its healthy green and blue, while the toxic foam is fading away. This is a great message when we say goodbye to 2020. The inner page is simple and cheerful, with a "hello 2021" decorated by flowers and ivies.

Technically, this work consists of a printing part and a painting part. Our typical trick of making cards is to print the main body so we can mass produce, and to paint on top of it for customization. We play this trick over and over and it works. For this work, we made three rubber stamps, one for the virus on the cover, one for "hello 2021" with the ivies, and one for the orange flowers. The painting part is mainly by watercolors, and a little bit of ball pens. One special technique on the virus body is to sprinkle salt on it when the paint is still wet. The salt bleaches out some colors and leaves very fine marks on it to give a lot of different shades to the same color, creating a very "chemical" texture.

We were in general satisfied with the result, and the reception has been positive so far. I consider it a success, except the message itself, which is proven not so accurate at this moment--we are one month into 2021 and the pandemic is still hanging around here.
