      <description>There is a pretty nice space above the bed on the headboard side in our bedroom. FC and I talked about hanging up a larger painting to replace the current one, which is kind of too small to the wall space, as seen in the picture below.
An oil painting by myself (Spree at Night - oil on canvas, 50 cm x 40 cm, link to Instagram) is hanging on the wall above our headboard.</description>
