      <description>As a visual artist, my greatest interest is to explore different light effects such as transmission, reflection, diffusion etc, in both the objective and the abstract settings. In the objective setting, the primary theme of my works is the urban life in Berlin. With such a specific geographic scope, the aim is to capture the atmosphere and people&amp;rsquo;s daily activities, and very importantly, the rapid transformation of the look of the city itself.</description>
