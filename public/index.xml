      <description>There is a pretty nice space above the bed on the headboard side in our bedroom. FC and I talked about hanging up a larger painting to replace the current one, which is kind of too small to the wall space, as seen in the picture below.
An oil painting by myself (Spree at Night - oil on canvas, 50 cm x 40 cm, link to Instagram) is hanging on the wall above our headboard.</description>

      <description>As a visual artist, my greatest interest is to explore different light effects such as transmission, reflection, diffusion etc, in both the objective and the abstract settings. In the objective setting, the primary theme of my works is the urban life in Berlin. With such a specific geographic scope, the aim is to capture the atmosphere and people&amp;rsquo;s daily activities, and very importantly, the rapid transformation of the look of the city itself.</description>
